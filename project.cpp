Project: Patient Symptom Analysis and Self Diagnosis

1st Module: Ambiguous Symptom Entry Patients describe their symptoms using natural language, where the system processes partial or unclear inputs to identify possible symptoms using advanced matching algorithms (e.g., levenstindistance or KMP).

2nd Module: Limited Medical Awareness Based on the identified symptoms, the system asks targeted yes/no questions to narrow down possibilities and predict the most likely disease using decision analysis techniques.(Desicion tree)

3rd Module: Shortest Path to Medical Facility Once a disease is identified, the system calculates the shortest path to the nearest medical facility using graph-based algorithms like Dijkstra's for quick access to care.(Steps of Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

4th Module: Prescription and Precaution After confirming the disease, the system provides a tailored prescription, lifestyle precautions, and advice, ensuring the patient takes immediate steps for recovery.(Brute force string matching )

Hello, Praveen Palkar 👋
I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

🛠 Projects
Project 1: The Patient Symptom Analysis and Self Diagnosis system is a comprehensive tool designed to enhance the healthcare experience for individuals. It intelligently processes vague or unclear symptom inputs, narrows down diagnoses through targeted questions, ensures quick access to medical facilities, and provides personalized treatment recommendations. With these four integrated modules, the system aims to provide timely and accurate healthcare guidance, empowering patients to make informed decisions while seeking medical attention.
